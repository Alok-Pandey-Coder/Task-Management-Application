# Task Management Application 📝

A sleek, high-performance productivity tool built with **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates core frontend engineering principles, including **CRUD operations**, **DOM manipulation**, and **client-side data persistence**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
* **Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Storage:** Web Storage API (LocalStorage)

## ✨ Key Features
- **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks seamlessly.
- **Persistent Data:** Integrated **LocalStorage** to ensure that tasks remain saved even after a browser refresh or session close.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Real-time DOM manipulation ensures the interface stays in sync with the underlying data without page reloads.
- **Task Filtering:** Efficiently manage workflows by sorting tasks into "Pending" and "Completed" categories using JavaScript **Array methods** (`filter`, `map`).
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
- **Event Delegation:** Optimized performance by attaching a single event listener to parent elements rather than individual list items.
- **State Management:** Used JavaScript Objects and Arrays to maintain a consistent internal state of the application.
- **Clean Code:** Followed modular programming principles to ensure the script is readable and easy to maintain.
